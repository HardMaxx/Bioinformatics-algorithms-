You should implement an exact algorithm with polynomial complexity that performs the following steps:
- loading any graph directed from a text file,
- checking if the loaded graph is a conjugate,
- if the graph is a conjugate, check if it is a line graph,
- printing a message about the result of the above check,
- if the graph is a conjugate, transforming it into its original graph (H),
- saving the result graph H to a text file other than the input file, but in the same format.
