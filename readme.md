## General Information
It is a console application that checking if the loaded graph is a graph adjoint and if the graph is a adjointe, transforming it into its original graph.


## Technologies Used
- The tool is written in C++


## Features
- loading any graph directed from a text file,
- checking if the loaded graph is a graph adjoint,
- if the graph is a adjoint, check if it is a line graph,
- printing a message about the result of the above check,
- if the graph is a adjoint, transforming it into its original graph (H),
- saving the result graph H to a text file other than the input file, but in the same format. 

## Usage

Position the file in the program that contains the graph you want to examine and run the program.
